**5. A rank of top 10 biggest earners at the company:**

a) Ten highest salaries
```excel
=LARGE(INDIRECT("attrition!J$2:J$1471"), ROW(A1))
```

b) Additional information ('emp_id' column)
```excel
=INDEX(attrition!E2:E1471, MATCH(LARGE(attrition!J2:J1471, ROW(A1)), attrition!J2:J1471, 0))
```

c) Rank column
```excel
=RANK.EQ($B6,$B$6:$B$15,0)
```


*Explanation:*
- I used =LARGE formula to find the biggest salary in 'attrition!J$2:J$1471' a.k.a 'monthly_income' column.
- The formula is supplemented by ROW(A1) which allowed me to find the second, third, forth etc. values.
- Next, I chose INDEX&MMATCH to find my additional data - each employee's id. I added '0' value to find the exact value for each row. The 'attrition!E2:E11471' column contains emp_id.
- The $B6 in =RANK.EQ formula stands for a first cell in the 'ten highest salaries' column, while '$B$6:$B$15' is the range of 'ten highest salaries'.



**Result:**
|Monthy Income| Emp_Id| Rank|
|------------|--------|-----|
|19999	|259   | 1|
|19973	|1035	|2|
|19943	|1191	|3|
|19847	|1282	|4|
|19845	|1038	|5|
|19833	|1255	|6|
|19740	|1338	|7|
|19717	|1069	|8|
|19701	|1128	|9|

**8. Find the average distance from home and the number of employees who live further than the average:**

a) The average distance:
```excel
=ROUND(AVERAGE('satisfaction survey'!E:E),1)
```

b) Employees who live further than that:
```excel
=COUNTIF('satisfaction survey'!E:E,">"&$B$2)
```

*Explanation:*
- $B$2 in =COUNTIF formula refers to a cell containing 'average distance' data.

**Results:**

a)

|Average Distance|
|----|
|9.2|


b)

|Employees who live far|
|----|
|530|
